<p1> The Problem I currently have with dell keyboard and the mouse is that  I have accidently thrown it away based on the 
    job that was given to me by the association called the BAFTAS British film Television Association Show etc.
     It was amazing bveing there and it prevailed and made mine life easier and fun. 
     I played a  golden saxopone hat I bought from America, Stanton Island. 
 Moving on it was when I hated the shafting of me from the United kingdom.</p1>

 <li> How do I get it back it must be taken away from Scrap Yard which is far away from my work place. </li>

 <p5> The best thing about fulfiling the dell keyboard was working for Oxfam and making sure that in the United Kingdom,
     They protected the items in order to make sure that it does broken or get damaged by the simpliest of things. </p5>

<p1> The Problem I currently have with dell keyboard and the mouse is that  I have accidently thrown it away based on the 
    job that was given to me by the association called the BAFTAS British film Television Association Show etc.
     It was amazing going there and it prevailed and made mine life easier and fun. 
     I played a  golden saxopone hat I bought from America, Stanton Island. 
 Moving on it was when I hated the shafting of me from the United kingdom.</p1>
<br><br>
<li> Keyboard And Mouse </li> 
 <li> How do I get it back it must be taken away from Scrap-Yard which is far away from my work place. </li>

 <p5> The best thing about fulfiling the dell keyboard was working for Oxfam and making sure that in the United Kingdom,
     They protected the items in order to make sure that it does broken or get damaged by the simpliest of things. </p5>
<br>
<p6> I think that it is better for me to be able to make sure that next time I do not lose the expensive Keyboard and mouse because they were very expensive
    However if I want to affrod something like that I have to work at the charity shop to gain them back. In other words losing something is not 
    simple I have a seagate harddrive and a Samsung A4 Core. Clearly this wasn't put in the bin for the hoboes to use and have fun with. I want to say that 
South Africa has something wrong about it. On top of that its a CD I used for love that won't come back even when I gave to someone at work. </p6>

  <p6> The video ahead expains the fact that you must keep your equipment in the best possible place not to break them other, The floor should be 
      very soft and won't destory the equipment.

This is lost or thrown in the bin. I must get it back. I must find it.  
I find hard to find out why I did that it is a Phsycology thing that I was put in. The are bookos that can get people to not 
lose there stuff but this is what it is so far. Please forgive me if I have been over talkitive about this. 

### This is just information about the keyboard:

## What are the keyboard rows?
The horizontal rows of character keys in the typing area have specific names. For example, when placing your hands on the keyboard, they should be positioned over the home row keys. The keys below the home row are called the bottom row keys, and above the home row keys are the top row keys.
